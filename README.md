# Autonomous-Underwater-Cleaner

This is my 4th year capstone project. This project involves moving a vehicle according to debris in a swimming pool.

In this project, I have used Matlab to integrate Kinect depth camera with Arduino to control the movement of a BLDC motor.

Depth camera uses IR sensor to detect distance to the object of each pixel in the depth image and show the distance as a int value. If you're interested, please visit https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XwNVv95Zc1QdUxMaeDjMww_OeJPeuk_Z/view?usp=sharing for this vehicle's final report.
