# Autonomous-Underwater-Cleaner

This is my 4th year capstone project. This project involves moving a vehicle according to debris in a swimming pool using image segmentation.

In this project, I have used Matlab to integrate Kinect depth camera with Arduino to control the movement of a BLDC motor.

Depth camera combines IR sensor and RGB image to detect distance to the targeted object. If you're interested, please visit https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XwNVv95Zc1QdUxMaeDjMww_OeJPeuk_Z/view?usp=sharing for this vehicle's final report.

The image processing algorithm description starts from page 28.
